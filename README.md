# thrift-minimal-example
A minimal example of Golang and Nodejs talking throught Thrift.

In `gen-go` you can find an example of a server on file `server.go` while you can also find a client example in `gen-go/client/client.go`.

There is also a client implementation in nodejs within `gen-nodejs/client.js`
